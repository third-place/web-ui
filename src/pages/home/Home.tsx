            A New Social Network
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Third place is an open source social network. The code that powers this site is free for anyone to download, view, and modify. We embrace open source because that is how we learned to program, and we hope others find this project useful in their learning journey.

            While Third place is in closed beta, invite codes are required for signing up.

            Why Third Place?
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Here are some reasons we think Third place will be your new social home:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>share your thoughts and photos</li>
            <li>no ads</li>
            <li>no bots</li>
            <li>control your experience</li>
            <li>RSS support</li>
            <li>de-cluttered user interface</li>

            Todo List
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            There is still a lot of work to do in order to get Third place ready for prime time. Here are some of the features we need before we can launch to the public:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li><b>SES integration with cognito</b> will allow for branded, customized emails. Right now there is a (slightly scary) generic email from AWS Cognito for confirmation codes.</li>
            <li><b>Single region instances, multi-region deployment</b> model for production. Right now, we have essentially the opposite: a single production instance spread out over multiple regions. This is not ideal for a number of reasons, but was chosen due to various free tiers for services Third place uses.</li>
            <li><b>MFA support</b> for increased security. As a service provider, supporting MFA in 2022 is pretty necessary.</li>
          </ul>

      { loggedInUser && (
        <NewPost onPostCreated={getPosts} />
      )}
      <h2>Public Posts</h2>
      { posts && (
        <PostCollection
          posts={posts}
          reloadPosts={getPosts}
          onDelete={removePost}
        />
      )}
    </Container>
  );
}
